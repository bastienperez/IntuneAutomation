## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed to help IT administrators automate common Microsoft Intune management operations. All scripts use the Microsoft Graph API and are organized by functional category for easy discovery and use.

### ✨ Key Features

- **📱 Device Management**: Automated device operations and lifecycle management
- **🔒 Security & Compliance**: Automated compliance reporting and security operations  
- **📦 Application Management**: Streamlined app deployment and management
- **📊 Monitoring & Reporting**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics tools
- **☁️ Azure Integration**: Native support for Azure Automation runbooks
- **🔐 Security-First**: Built with enterprise security best practices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Execution (Recommended for Testing)

The simplest way to use these scripts is to **download and run them locally**:

1. **📥 Download the scripts** you need from this repository
2. **📦 Install required modules** (the scripts will prompt you if needed)
3. **▶️ Run the scripts** directly from PowerShell with appropriate parameters
4. **📋 Review the output** and logs for results

Most scripts are designed to work immediately without additional setup beyond the required PowerShell modules.

**Example:**
```powershell
# Download a script and run it
.\Get-DeviceComplianceReport.ps1 -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
```

### Option 2: Azure Automation (unattended execution and scheduling)

For **scheduling**, **unattended execution**, or **more complex automation**, you can deploy these scripts as Azure Automation Runbooks:

#### Step 1: Create Managed Identity
Create a **User Assigned Managed Identity** in your Azure tenant through the Azure Portal.

#### Step 2: Grant Permissions
Use our setup script to grant necessary Microsoft Graph permissions:

```powershell
# Grant default Intune permissions to your managed identity
.\grant-permissions-managed-identity.ps1 -ManagedIdentityDisplayName "YourManagedIdentityName"

# Or grant custom permissions for specific use cases
.\grant-permissions-managed-identity.ps1 -ManagedIdentityDisplayName "YourManagedIdentityName" -CustomPermissions @("User.Read.All", "Group.Read.All")
```

#### Step 3: Configure Azure Automation
1. **Assign the managed identity** to your Azure Automation Account
2. **Import the scripts** as runbooks
3. **Schedule execution** as needed

This approach enables:
- **⏰ Scheduled execution** (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **🤖 Unattended operations** without user interaction
- **📈 Centralized logging** and monitoring
- **🔗 Integration** with other Azure services

### Default Permissions for Automation

The `grant-permissions-managed-identity.ps1` script grants these Microsoft Graph API permissions by default:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All` | Full device management access |
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` | Configuration policy management |
| `DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All` | Application management |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` | Service configuration |
| `DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All` | Role-based access control |
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All` | Advanced device operations |

These permissions cover most common Intune automation scenarios.

### Popular Scripts

- **Device Operations**: Bulk device actions, automated device cleanup
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance dashboards and alerts
- **App Management**: Silent app deployment and update automation
- **Security Monitoring**: Threat detection and response automation

> 💡 **Tip**: Each script category includes detailed documentation and usage examples.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### If you are running the scripts locally
- **PowerShell 5.1** or later (PowerShell 7+ recommended)
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules**: 
  - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
- **You have to sign in with an Intune Admin account**

### If you are running the scripts in Azure Automation as a Runbook
- **Azure Automation Account**
- **User Assigned Managed Identity** with the following permissions:
  - `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All`
  - `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All`
  - `DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All`
  - `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All`
  - `DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All`
  - `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All`

> 💡 **Tip**: Check `grant-permissions-managed-identity.ps1` for more details and how to grant the permissions

- **Your Environment in the Azure Automation Account has to have the following modules installed:**
  - `Az.Accounts`
  - `Az.Resources`
  - `Microsoft.Graph.Applications`
  - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`

### Authentication Methods Supported
- **Interactive Authentication** (default for local execution)
- **Managed Identity** (recommended for Azure Automation)
